# Most_Frequent_Number
To find the most frequent number I have used Binary Search Tree. It gives my code faster performance and Algorithm complexity is better compared to other data structures. 

My code has some parts.
  1. Binary Search Tree (insert, get, delete, print_tree)
  2. num.txt file, which store only integer numbers.
  3. Finding the most frequent number..
